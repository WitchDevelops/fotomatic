# About
This is a learning project from CodeCademy. It's a landing page for a new camera.
This project was coded based on the provided starter code (HTML, CSS). [Design was provided](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/capstone-1/specs/fotomatic_spec_landing_v2.png), but I decided to modernize it to hone my web design skill.

# IT'S WORK IN PROGRESS

# My process
First, design. it was dated, so I tweaked it a bit. Then, accessibility. Starter code was overusing divs, so I refactored it to use semantic markup. After that, features. I added more content and features for a more functional page. Majority of the descriptions were generated using ChatGPT (not [GTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanosine_triphosphate)).

# Tech
- semantic HTML5,
- custom CSS,
- vanilla JavaScript.

# Features
* fully responsive design;
* hover effects using CSS transitions and pseudoclasses;
* glassmorphic effect in the "about" section;
* accordion menu animated with JS;
* simple sign-up form for a mailing list using POST method.

# TO-DO
* add email form
* improve the accordion (open tab closes when opeing a new one)
* add second CTA
* fix responsiveness
* re-color
* change font faces
